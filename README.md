Machine Learning Project - 2: Handwritten Letter Classification Challenge

Train a machine learning model to classify any 10 letters from one of the Indian languages(have taken kanada dataset). The project involves the following steps;

1. Collect images of handwritten letters of one of the Indian languages 
2. Split the data into train and test tests (80% train and 20% test)
3. Use dimension reduction techniques, PCA and t-SNE to reduce the dimensions of the data
4. Train a classification model using neural networks and support vector machines on the training data
5. Validate the model on the test data 
6. Fine tune the parameters to increase the classification accuracies of the model on training and test data.
